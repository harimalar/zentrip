## Introduction

Ziptrip ("App", "we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your personal information and your right to privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and what rights you have in relation to it.

By using Ziptrip, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

## 1. Information We Collect

### a) Information You Provide
- Travel documents (description, expiry dates, notes) you add to the Travel Vault.
- Packing list items and categories you create.
- Sticky notes and personal reminders.
- Currency preferences and pinned currencies.
- Trip route and departure dates you enter.

### b) Information We Do NOT Collect
We do not collect, transmit, or store any of the above information on external servers. All data is stored exclusively on your device (via UserDefaults and iCloud if enabled). We have no access to your personal content.

### c) Biometric Data
If you enable Face ID / Touch ID to lock the Travel Vault, the App uses Apple's LocalAuthentication framework. Your biometric data never leaves your device and is never accessible to us.

### d) Exchange Rate Data
When the Convert feature fetches exchange rates, a network request is made to an open exchange rate API. No personally identifiable information (PII) is transmitted in this request.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

We use the information entirely on-device to:
- Display your trips, packing lists, notes, and vault documents.
- Compute currency conversions.
- Authenticate you via biometrics when the Vault is locked.

We do **not** use your information for advertising, analytics, or any commercial purpose.

## 3. Data Storage & iCloud Sync

All app data is stored locally on your device. If you enable iCloud Sync, your data is stored in your private iCloud container (managed by Apple, governed by Apple's iCloud Terms and Privacy Policy). We do not have access to your iCloud data.

## 4. Data Retention & Deletion

Since we do not store your data on any server, deletion is fully in your control:
- Delete the App to erase all locally stored data.
- Disable iCloud Sync and remove the App from your iCloud account to delete cloud copies.

## 6. Third-Party Services

The App may use the following third-party service:

We are not responsible for the privacy practices of third-party services.

## 7. Security

We implement appropriate technical measures to protect your information. However, no method of electronic storage is 100% secure. We encourage you to use the biometric lock feature for sensitive documents.

## 8. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes become effective when posted within the App. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
